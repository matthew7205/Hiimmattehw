<p>As you back away slowly, the snake creeps into another hole.  Once the coast was clear, you ran back to your friend who had died during the time that passed.  Leaving your friend, you attempt to leave the forest.  After hiking 20 miles, you stumble upon a rundown shack.  Do you dare to enter?  There is a sign that says tresspassers beware!  Maybe it would be safer to walk it.  Make your choice before you run out of daylight.</p>
