        You decided to not eat the red vine and watched your friend eat the rope and get poison red-vine-ivy in the inside of your body.  Too bad.  Your friend died.</p>

    <p>As your friend dies, you dig a shallow grave for your friend.  As you are digging, you discover a small sour-punch snake.  Act fast or you may get eaten.</p>
